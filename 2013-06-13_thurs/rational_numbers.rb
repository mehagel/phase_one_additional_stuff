# Remember, the rational numbers are the set of numbers
# that can be expressed as a ratio two of integers, like
# 1/2, 10234/567, 0/1, -4/5, etc.
#
# We write them as X/Y where X is called the "numerator"
# and Y is called the "denominator."  This notation is
# 100% convention.  We could just as easily write them
# as (X,Y) or X:Y or X|Y.
#
# For this exercise it's important to think about a
# rational number as a pair of integers with special
# addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. operations
# and their own notion of equality.
#
# For example, we say that two rational numbers a/b and c/d
# are "equal" if a*d equals b*c.  This "equals" is defined
# in terms of the word "equals" for the integers -- we're equivocating
# a bit by re-using the same word.
