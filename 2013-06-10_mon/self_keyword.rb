# Mark: The Self keyword is used to refer to the Class itself if it in the class method
# or if it is in instance method it refers to that particular instance of class


# Dean: When used within an object, the self keyword is tantamount to using that
# object's name to drill down the specificity of where and how that method is
# being called. For example, if you attach a method to "self" during a class
# declaration, the method will be attached to that class (which is itself an 
# object) rather than any instance of that class.
